## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Backend

#### Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanhillman/capstone-project.git
cd capstone-project/backend

#### Create and activate virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv venv

##### Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

##### Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

#### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Run database migrations
python manage.py db upgrade

#### Start backend
python manage.py runserver

The backend will run on: 

http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Frontend
cd capstone-project/frontend

#### Install dependencies
npm install

#### Run development server
npm run serve

The frontend will run on: 

Local: http://localhost:3000
(works with Auth0)

Network: http://<your-ip>:3000
(may show Auth0 error: requires HTTPS/secure origin)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

Auth0 requires secure origins.
Works with http://localhost:3000
Fails on http://<LAN-IP>:3000 unless HTTPS is configured

Some deprecated dependencies may show warnings (e.g., sass-loader, legacy-js-api).
